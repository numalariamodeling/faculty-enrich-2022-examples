# Malaria Modeling Faculty Enrichment Program 2022

### Technical track (EMOD)

Example scripts for the [weekly lessons](https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/lessons/) of the faculty enrichment
program 2022.

**Prerequisites**: 
Before running the weekly example scripts, please ensure that EMOD and dtk have been successfully [installed]((https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/modules/install-emod/))
and that the [repository has been cloned](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
to your local computer, ideally under _/<.username>/Documents/faculty-enrich-2022-examples_.
It also needs dtk virtual environment loaded and assumes files are run from a working directory set to where the script is located.

## Week 1: Overview of EMOD <a name="week1"></a>

[Lesson Week 1](https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/lessons/week-1/)

EMOD How To's:

- Update _simtools.ini_
- Define _exp_name_ and identify _expt_id_

### Instructions

<details><summary><span>Click to expand</span></summary>
<p>

- Adjust paths in `simtools.ini` by replacing `<USERNAME>` with your username in path (5 locations)
- Run simulation via `python run_exampleSim.py`
- Wait simulation to finish (~5 minutes)
    - Note, when running locally, the console might return an <span style="color:#ff6666">psutil.AccessDenied
      text</span>
      error, however the simulation can still successfully run and finish.
    - If there are problems with running locally, you can peek into [Week 6](#week6) on how to change `SetupParser` to
      run on _COMPS_ (requires login)!
- Go to the `experiments/` folder to notice the generated simulation experiment named '
  username_FE_2022_example_w1___2022_04_29_02_14_46_106520' The last part after the '___' is the experiment id and
  changes with each simulation.
- Update expt_id in `analyze_exampleSim_w1.py` Line 14 (copy number sequence after ___, also printed to console)
- Run analyzer via `python analyze_exampleSim_w1.py`
- Inspect `simulation_outputs/` to see generated simulation results (csv file and plot)
- Done!

## Week 2: Basic building blocks of EMOD <a name="week2"></a>

[Lesson Week 2](https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/lessons/week-2/)

EMOD How To's:

- [Update config parameters](https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/modules/emod-how-to/emod-how-to/#update-config-parameters)
- [Create a demographics file](https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/modules/emod-how-to/emod-how-to/#create-a-demographics-file)
- [Create climate files](https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/modules/emod-how-to/emod-how-to/#create-climate-files)
- [Add summary reports](https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/modules/emod-how-to/emod-how-to/#add-summary-reports) (
  annual)
- [Set up multi-simulation experiments](https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/modules/emod-how-to/emod-how-to/#using-the-model-builder-to-set-up-multi-simulation-experiments)


### Instructions

<details><summary><span>Click here to expand</span></summary>
<p>

- Create _demographics_ and _climate_ files via `python generate_input_files.py` _(requires access to COMPS for climate database : ask someone from NU team)_
- Update default parameters in `run_exampleSim.py`:

    ```py
    cb.update_params({
        'Demographics_Filenames': [os.path.join('Ghana', 'Ghana_2.5arcmin_demographics.json')],
        "Air_Temperature_Filename": os.path.join('Ghana', 'Ghana_30arcsec_air_temperature_daily.bin'),
        "Land_Temperature_Filename": os.path.join('Ghana', 'Ghana_30arcsec_air_temperature_daily.bin'),
        "Rainfall_Filename": os.path.join('Ghana', 'Ghana_30arcsec_rainfall_daily.bin'),
        "Relative_Humidity_Filename": os.path.join('Ghana', 'Ghana_30arcsec_relative_humidity_daily.bin'),
        "Age_Initialization_Distribution_Type": 'DISTRIBUTION_COMPLEX'
    })
    ```
- Add custom reporter with annual summary for different age groups (see EMOD How To's) or suggested example below. Add the import statement at the top and the call to `add_summary_report()` around line 26 (before `run_sim_args` is defined):
  ```py
  from malaria.reports.MalariaReport import add_summary_report
  add_summary_report(cb, start=1, interval=365,
                   age_bins=[0.25, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 100, 120], 
                   description='Annual_Agebin')
  ```
- Increase simulation duration from 1 to 3 years by modifying the initial call to DTKConfigBuilder:
  ```py 
  years = 3
  cb = DTKConfigBuilder.from_defaults('MALARIA_SIM', Simulation_Duration=years*365)
  ```
- Change _exp_name_  for week 2 `f'{user}_FE_2022_example_w2'`
- Run simulation as learned in week 1 and wait for simulation to finish (~5 minutes)
    - Note, if there are problems with running locally, you can peek into [Week 6](#week6) on how to
      change `SetupParser` to run on _COMPS_ (requires login)!
- Run analyzer script for Week 2 `analyze_exampleSim_w2.py` (don't forget to update expt_id!)
- Inspect `simulation_outputs` and the generated plots
    - Optional: rerun analyzer with plot for week 1 and compare.
    - _Note that EMOD is a stochastic model and any changes at low population size and few repetitions might be at
      random and not necessarily due to the parameter change!_
- Run additional simulations with different durations, population sizes or for different agebins _(Tip: change exp_name
  to keep track of your simulations)_
  ```py 
  # Example of how to change additional parameters from the config file
  cb.update_params({
        'x_Base_Population': 1,
        'x_Birth': 1,
        'x_Temporary_Larval_Habitat': 1
    })
  ```
- Again, inspect the simulation outputs and compare them against each other:
    - How do the outcomes change?
    - What do you recognize about running time?

            </p>
            </details>
- To keep track of the campaign events in the simulations, add `event_list` and expand as needed
  via  `event_list = event_list + [<new_event_name>]`
    - Event
      names:  `'Received_Treatment', 'Received_Severe_Treatment','Received_ITN','Received_IRS', 'Received_SMC', 'Received_Vaccine' `
      For example, if you added case management and ITNs, define `event_list` like this:
        ``` py
      event_list = ['Received_Treatment', 'Received_ITN']
      ```
- Next, add an event reporter to monitor these events:
    - Report_Event_Counter for aggregated event counts:
      ``` py
      from malaria.reports.MalariaReport import add_event_counter_report

      add_event_counter_report(cb, event_trigger_list=event_list, start=0, duration=10000)
      ```
    - Report_Event_Recorder for individual events:
      ``` py
      cb.update_params({
         "Report_Event_Recorder": 1,
         "Report_Event_Recorder_Individual_Properties": [],
         "Report_Event_Recorder_Ignore_Events_In_List": 0,
         "Report_Event_Recorder_Events": event_list,
         'Custom_Individual_Events': event_list
      })
      ```
      _Note the Report_Event_Recorder output can get very large and usually is disabled for large interventions_
- Change _exp_name_ for week 3 `f'{user}_FE_2022_example_w3a'`
- Now, run the simulation and wait for it to finish (~5 minutes)
- While simulations runs, look at the generated campaign file, does it include all interventions
  specified?
    - The `campaign.json` file is located in your experiment simulation folder.
- Run analyzer script for Week 3 (`analyze_exampleSim_w3a.py`) 
    - Don't forget to update _expt_id_!
    - And update `event_list` in the analyzer to what you used in `run_exampleSim.py`
- Inspect the different results generated in `simulation_outputs`.
    - Are all intervention events happening as expected?
    - Parameters changes you can explore with further simulations:
        - disable and enable interventions by changing coverage: be sure to change your experiment name if you run more experiments.
            - does malaria transmission get interrupted if you set all to 1?
        - age group receiving an intervention

#### PART II - multi-simulation experiment using ModBuilder

<details><summary><span>Click here to expand</span></summary>
<p>

- Add `ModBuilder` to allow running different parameter sweeps
    ```py
    from simtools.ModBuilder import ModBuilder, ModFn

    numseeds = 3
    builder = ModBuilder.from_list([[ModFn(case_management, cm_cov_U5),                     
                                     ## ModFn(xxx_intervention, coverage_level=xxx_cov),  # adjust to add other interventions
                                     ModFn(DTKConfigBuilder.set_param, 'Run_Number', x)
                                    ]
                                    for cm_cov_U5 in [0.4, 0.6] 
                                    ## for xxx_cov in [0, 0.6] 
                                    for x in range(numseeds)
                                    ])
    ```

    Adjust the `run_sim_args` block to include the builder:
    ```py
    run_sim_args = {
        'exp_name': f'{user}_FE_2022_example_w3',
        'config_builder': cb,
        'exp_builder' : builder
    }
    ```

- ModBuilder can consume the same `add_x()` functions we used above, but it's often cleaner to wrap each `add_x()` into another function. For each intervention you wrap and use in the builder, make sure that it's not ALSO called directly using `add_x()`.

- change _exp_name_  to `f'{user}_FE_2022_example_w3b'` and the simulation is ready to go!
  
- Run simulations 
    - While waiting, check out the generated experiment folder, that now includes more subfolders for each of the
      single simulations. Open two campaign files and compare, do you see any differences?   
      _(Tip: Many text editors allow side by side comparison of two scripts, automatically highlighting differences)_

- Open second analyzer script for Week 3 (`analyze_exampleSim_w3b.py`) to update the _exp_id_ as usual, but now also check 
  that all the relevant sweep variables are included in _sweep_variables_ and all the events of interest are included in _event_list_. 
  The sweep_variables need to change according to the `ModBuilder` and custom functions that return parameters, which
  uniquely define single simulations.
  ```py
      ## Example of sweep_variables in analyzer (customize to your simulation)  
      sweep_variables = ['cm_cov_U5', 'smc_coverage', 'itn_coverage', 'irs_coverage', 'rtss_coverage', 'Run_Number']
  ```
- Inspect `simulation_outputs` and compare against outputs from the previous week.  
  
- Change intervention parameters in the `ModBuilder` and repeat the simulation process to become more familiar with the
  whole process.  

<details><summary><span>Check results</span></summary>
<p>

The generated result figures include separate lines. The `Run_Numbers` were aggregated using the mean and the intervention
coverage levels are used as additional grouping variables when aggregating simulation outputs. You may need to adjust the location of the legend if it's covering your plot!

Examples with 4 levels of case management and 2 levels (off and on) of SMC:

Note, if too many parameters changed at once without clear labelling, the results can become difficult to interpret!

### Instructions

#### PART I - Analyzer

<details><summary><span>Click here to expand</span></summary>
<p>

- Cleanup your simulation script of any unwanted interventions that were explored during the previous week (keep a
  copy!)
    - Adjust coverage levels in `ModBuilder` to select/unselect interventions to include or change number of simulations
      to run (optional)
- If not already there, enable or modify the individual-level event reporter as shown below. This example assumes there is case management for malaria in the simulation.
  ```py
  cb.update_params({
    'Report_Event_Recorder': 1,  # Enable generation of ReportEventRecorder.csv  
    'Report_Event_Recorder_Ignore_Events_In_List': 0, # Logical indicating whether to include or exclude the events specified in the list 
    'Report_Event_Recorder_Events': ['NewClinicalCase', 'Received_Treatment'], # List of events to include
    })
    ```
- Add a new summary report with monthly monitoring for _children under the age of 5 years_ only (keep min age 0.25)
  ```py
  for year in range(years):
    start_day = 365 + 365 * year
    sim_year = sim_start_year + year
    add_summary_report(cb, start=start_day, interval=30,
                       age_bins=[0.25, 5, 100],
                       description=f'Monthly_U5_{sim_year}')
    ```  
- Add `MalariaFilteredReport` which is the same as `InsetChart` but we can ask only to report on part of the simulation time (or just a subset of nodes, for spatial simulations).
  ```py
  from malaria.reports.MalariaReport import add_filtered_report, add_event_counter_report
  add_filtered_report(cb, start=(years-1)*365, end=years * 365)
  ```
   - Any analyzer script in [analyzer_collection.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/faculty-enrich-2022-examples/blob/main/analyzer_collection.py)
      that uses `InsetChart.json` can use `ReportMalariaFiltered.json` instead if you update the `self.filenames=` section.

- Change _exp_name_ to `f'{user}_FE_2022_example_w4'` for week 4
- Run simulations
    - While simulations are running, you may take a look at `analyze_exampleSim_w4.py`, and corresponding `analyzer_collection.py` to
      explore the different Analyzer Classes used, no need to understand these in detail!
- Run the analyzer script `analyze_exampleSim_w4.py` (_remember to change exp_id :)_ )
    - This time, we didn't automatically generate plots! Now up to you to generate the plots you need.
- Inspect `simulation_outputs` and familiarize yourself with the csv files and match them to the analyzer + reports used in
  the simulation
- Run additional simulations and change the reports, for instance the agebins or reporting interval, and edit the
  analyzer accordingly (both `analyze_exampleSim_w4.py`, and corresponding `analyzer_collection.py`)!
    - __Change age group__:
        - Add summary report for children under the age of 10 (U10) in your simulation script.
        - In the analyzer script, copy the analyzer _MonthlyPfPRAnalyzerU5_ and replace U5 with U10
            - _voilà_  a new analyzer for malaria outcomes aggregated for children under the age of 10 has been created!
            - The principle of the MonthlyPfPRAnalyzers is the same for any age group as long as the indexing and number
              of agebins are matched correctly!  
              
    - __Change monitoring interval__:
        - Add summary report for weekly reporting in your simulation script.
        - Note: In practice a monitoring intervals of either 365 or 30 days are easiest to interpret and collected
          data is also often per months or year. But in some occassions and also for exercise, weekly agebins might
          be of interest too (for shorter total simulation period).  
          
    - __Analyze additional outcome measures__ to look at (no new simulation needed)
        - Look at the json file under `DataByTimeAndAgeBins` (in COMPS or Notepadd++)
            - additional outcome examples 'New Infections by Age Bin', 'Annual Moderate Anemia by Age Bin', 'Mean
              Log Parasite Density by Age Bin'
        - Add additional lines for new outcome measure, i.e. New Infections
              ```py 
                d = data[fname]['DataByTimeAndAgeBins']['New Infections by Age Bin'][:12]
                new_infect = [x[age] for x in d] 
              ```
              ```py 
              simdata = pd.DataFrame({'month': range(1, 13),
                                      'PfPR': pfpr,
                                      'Cases': clinical_cases,
                                      'Severe cases': severe_cases,
                                      'New infections': new_infect, ## newly added
                                      'Pop': pop})
              ``` 
- Great! All the changes done demonstrate the flexibility of analyzers that can be highly customized to the user's and project needs.
  If you are interested to learn more about `reporters` and how to analyze them, check out the EMOD How To's or IDM's EMOD documentation!
- __Optional__:
  - Advanced: check the analyzer_collection.py for other analyzers that might be applicable to your simulation.
    You also may have noticed that there are 2 analyzer commented out in `analyze_exampleSim_w4.py` , you can try to uncomment them to enable them and rerun the analyzer.
    _(Using comments is a convenient way to adjust which analyzers to run.)_
  - It time: play around with [json_explorer.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/faculty-enrich-2022-examples/blob/main/json_explorer.py) in Pycharm interactively to better understand reading in data from json selectively!

#### PART II - Plotting

<details><summary><span>Click here to expand</span></summary>
<p>

- Check your csv files (see Part I) and make sure all required csv files were generated, optionally disable plots in the plotting script
  by commenting them out.
- Run plotting scripts either using Python or R:
    - _Python_: `plot_exampleSim_w4.py`
    - _R_: `plot_exampleSim_w4.R`
- Look at the figures more critically, anything you would like to change?
    - Given the interventions implemented does the curves look as expected?
- Open the plotting script of your choice (python or R) and adjust axis titles, colors or even add your own plot!
    - Note that the plots simply combine all sweep_variables in the legend. When having too many sweeps, the final output becomes difficult to interpret. 
      These plots are good for diagnostic checks of correctness of experiment simulated, but not for presenting to others.
- Some suggested explorations _(no need to do all, some more meaningful than others ;)
  - __plot_inset_chart__: per default plots selected channels over time per sweep_variables combination
    - a) modify `channels_inset_chart` to plot other channels (might need to adjust analyzer to write out more channels)
    - b) modify x axis to show date in different format and interval
    - c) change color for no intervention (case management only) to black.
    - d) add custom labels to sweep_variable combinations to have a better readable legend  
  - __plot_summary_report__:
    - a) apply some of the changes done for __plot_inset_chart__ to the summary report
    - b) when you have added an additional age group analyzer, modify `Uage` to plot results for the other age group
  - __plot_agebin_summary_report__: per default aggregates all years to plot agebins on the x-axis, and has
    multiple panels of defined channels (`channels_summary_report`).
    - a) modify the figure to have agebin as color and unique_scen as panels, with time on the x-axis (annual or
      monthly summary report csv)
    - b) modify the figure to have agebin as panels (facets) and time on the x-axis (annual or monthly summary
      report csv) 
  - __plot_events__:
   - a) adjust y-axis to for coverage channels to show values as percentage
   - b) set y-axis limits to have same y-axis for the left panels (number of individuals that received an intervention) 
     and for the right panels  (proportion of individuals that received an intervention)

### Instructions

#### PART I - Create a “Burn-in” simulation

<details><summary><span>Click here to expand</span></summary>
<p>

 - Create a new python script named 'run_exampleSim_w6a.py' 
 - Based on what you’ve learned from previous examples, add the basic code chunks needed to run a simulation, excluding interventions. 
   Check the details below for help and additional comments.
    - <details><summary><span style="color: blue";">Import modules </span></summary>

      </details>
      
    - <details><summary><span style="color: blue";">SetupParser and SimulationDuration </span></summary>
       <p>
       - Run the simulation with 1 seed, and for 50 years, for testing you might first select fewer years.
       - Instead of `years`, define `serialize_years` and use 1 seed only
       - To keep track of the corresponding time in your experiment, you can include `sim_start_year = 2022  - serialize_years`
	   
       ```py
        SetupParser.default_block = 'LOCAL'
        numseeds = 1
        serialize_years = 50
        sim_start_year = 2022  - serialize_years
    
        cb = DTKConfigBuilder.from_defaults('MALARIA_SIM', Simulation_Duration=serialize_years * 365)

    - <details><summary><span style="color: blue";">Reporting </span></summary>
       <p>
       Reporting during the burnin simulation is optional, it depends on the simulation duration and what you want to track or to check.
       If not disabled InsetChart is automatically included, and can be plotted, alternatively one can disable the InsetChart and 
       include an annual summary report to keep track of i.e. malaria metrics in an age group that is also plotted during the main simulation.

 - Now, to _serialize_ the simulations so that you can “pick up” from them again later, add the code chunk below to update the serialization configuration parameters.  (see [Simple Burn-In](https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/modules/emod-how-to/emod-how-to/#simple-burn-in) in EMOD How To's).  The section ideally would be placed before or after the other `cb.update_params` in your script (i.e. after defining Demographics)
    - <details><summary><span style="color: blue";">Serialization</span></summary>
       <p>
	 
       ```py
       cb.update_params({
           'Serialization_Time_Steps': [365 * serialize_years],
           'Serialization_Type': 'TIMESTEP',
           'Serialized_Population_Writing_Type': 'TIMESTEP',
           'Serialized_Population_Reading_Type': 'NONE',
           'Serialization_Mask_Node_Write': 0,
           'Serialization_Precision': 'REDUCED'
       })
       ```
        _Note: ‘serialize_years’ determines the duration of the simulation via `Simulation_Duration` is also used to define the `Serialization_Time_Steps`_
       </p>
      </details>
 - To test if your simulation experiment has been set up correctly run it for 1 year (`years = 1`).
 - Then run the experiment for 5 years.
 - Run the analyzer `analyze_exampleSim_w6.py` to visualize the trend 
   - Note, the analyzer script had been updated to allow running the same analyzer for PART I and PART II of the Week 6 examples,
     therefore, ensure that `step` is set to 'burnin' and update the `serialize_years` to correspond to the number of years run in the burnin experiment.
 - Optional: 
   - test out a longer simulation durations (50 years) and compare the time-series shown in the InsetChart plot.
     _Note: update the `exp_name` i.e. add 'burnin50', to keep track of your simulation iterations_

#### PART II- Create a “Pickup“ simulation

<details><summary><span>Click here to expand</span></summary>
<p>



- Create a new simulation experiment `run_exampleSim_w6b.py` that will be used to run a simulation pickung up from the burnin simulation you ran in PART I.
- To fill the script you can either:
   - copy the content from experiment script from week 4 `run_exampleSim_w4.py` that already has interventions and reporters defined, and check that the configuration parameters are the same in your burnin and 'pick up simualtion'. Specifically **demographics** and transmission configurations incl. **vector speies**,
   - copy the content from  `run_exampleSim_w6a.py` and add selected interventions and reporters of relevance to you for the future scenario simulation.
   - _Note that the start/end days for interventions and reports are relative to the beginning of the pick-up simulation - in other words, they re-start at zero._  
- Add custom or new parameters that define the simulation and burnin duration as well as ID of the burnin experiment:
  - `pickup_years` to define your SimulationDuration (i.e. 5-10 years). This will replace the `years` or  `serialize_years` that you had previously in the script.
  - `pull_years` to define the number of burnin years that were run  (corresponding to  `serialize_years` in  `run_exampleSim_w6a.py`  )
  - `burnin_id = <exp_id>` with the experiment_id from the burnin experiment you want to pick up from
  
    ```py

     burnin_id = "b4f6741c-07da-ec11-a9f8-b88303911bc1"  # UPDATE with burn-in experiment id
     pull_year = 50  # year of burn-in to pick-up from
     pickup_years = 2  # years of pick-up to run
     n_seeds = 3       # number of runs
     cb = DTKConfigBuilder.from_defaults('MALARIA_SIM', Simulation_Duration=pickup_years * 365)
     ``` 
- retrieve output path from burnin experiment (see [Picking up from Serialized Burn-in](https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/modules/emod-how-to/emod-how-to/#picking-up-from-serialized-burn-in)) in the EMOD How-To's. 
  - import `retrieve_experiment` function  via `from simtools.Utilities.Experiments import retrieve_experiment`
  - define `ser_df`
  
    ```py
      expt = retrieve_experiment(burnin_id)  # Identifies the desired burn-in experiment
      # Loop through unique "tags" to distinguish between burn-in scenarios (ex. varied historical coverage levels)
      ser_df = pd.DataFrame([x.tags for x in expt.simulations])
      ser_df["outpath"] = pd.Series([sim.get_path() for sim in expt.simulations])
    ```    
- Then, add/edit the serialization configuration parameters (so EMOD picks up this simulation from the one you ran in PART I). 

      ```py
      cb.update_params({
          'Serialized_Population_Reading_Type': 'READ',
          'Serialized_Population_Filenames': ['state-%05d.dtk' % (pull_year * 365)],
          'Serialized_Population_Path': os.path.join(ser_df["outpath"][0], 'output'),  # only use if having 1 single burnin
          'Enable_Random_Generator_From_Serialized_Population': 0,
          'Serialization_Mask_Node_Read': 0,
          'Enable_Default_Reporting': 1,
          'Disable_IP_Whitelist': 1
       })
       ```
       _Notes: `pull_year` refers to the year of the burn-in to pickup from, usually the last year or the burnin. 
        In this example, the simulation will pick-up on Jan 1 of year 50._
     - `Serialized_Population_Path` in the example above takes only the first scenario of the burnin simulation (`ser_df["outpath"][0]`). 
       To match simulation tags and run number in pick up to those in burnin (when running multiple burnin scenarios in one experiment)
        then `Serialized_Population_Path` needs to be defined in ModBuilder to allow sweeping through the scenarios of the burnin experiment (instead of `cb.update_params`)
		
        ```py
        builder = ModBuilder.from_list([
             [ModFn(DTKConfigBuilder.set_param, 'Serialized_Population_Path', os.path.join(row['outpath'], 'output')),
              ModFn(DTKConfigBuilder.set_param, 'Run_Number', seed)
             ]
             for r, row in ser_df.iterrows()
             for seed in range(numseeds)
              ])
        ```   
- Run the experiment 
- Open the analyzer for week 6 `analyze_exampleSim_w6.py` and change some defaults commented out for PART I, then run the analyzer and check generated results.
  - update exp_name to 6b instead 6a
  - update exp_id, as usual
  - set `step` to 'pickup', this parameter has been added to allow running the same analyzer for both steps burnin and pickup
- Run `plot_exampleSim_w6.py` and notice the two time-series for both simulations combined in a single plot

#### PART III - Compare “Pickup“ simulations across varying “Burn-in“ durations

<details><summary><span>Click here to expand</span></summary>
<p>

- If not already done, run `run_exampleSim_w6a.py` with a longer burn-in (i.e. 50 years).
- Update the `burnin_id` in `run_exampleSim_w6b.py` 
- Before running the experiment, update the `exp_name` i.e. add 'burnin50', to keep track of your simulation iterations
  _Do not_ change anything else in the pickup simulation, to allow comparability across iterations picking up from different burnin durations.
- Run the experiment
- Plot results using `plot_exampleSim_w6.py` or a custom plotter using summary report outcomes  
- Compare the plots between the experiments with 5 and 50 year burnins. Do you notice any difference?

## Week 7: Sweeping and calibration <a name="week7"></a>

Read [Lesson Week 7](https://faculty-enrich-2022.netlify.app/lessons/week-7/) to understand the basics of
sweeping and calibration, and the story behind this week's example.

### Instructions

<details><summary><span>Click here to expand</span></summary>
<p>

- Modify `run_exampleBurnin_w6.py` script with the following (You should duplicate and change the file name to `run_exampleBurnin_w6.py`.)
  + Change `serialize_years` to 20
  + Use `ModBuilder` to run 5 simulations instead of 1
  + ```
    numseeds = 5
    builder = ModBuilder.from_list([[ModFn(DTKConfigBuilder.set_param, 'Run_Number', x)]
                                    for x in range(numseeds)])
    ```
  + Add the `ModBuilder` object into `run_sim_args`
  + Modify `exp_name` in the `run_sim_args` to `f'{user}_FE_2022_example_w7a'`

- Run the burnin in COMPS
- Modify `burnin_id` in `run_examplePickup_w7.py`, understand what is the script trying to achieve here.
- Run the 'pickup' in COMPS
- Modify `expt_id` in `analyze_exampleSim_w7.py`
- Run the analyzer
- Finally run the script `select_w7.py`. This script calculate the average log-likelihood of each `itn_coverage` based on simulation output and produces some plots to visualize the parameter selection.
- Inspect the plot in the corresponding folder in `simulation_output` folder.
- (*Optional*) Try running the whole procedure but using `Ghana` input files instead. The (fake) Ghana DHS data is located in `data/w7_fake_DHS_Ghana.csv`. What do you need to change so that 
selection of parameters is based on this dataset?
- (*Optional*) The choice of the `itn_coverage` here is based on 5 realizations which some may argue that the sample size is too small. Try to redo the exercise by increasing the number of realizations. 
Note that you need to decide if you want to rerun the burnin, or just increase the number of realizations in the pickup phase instead (What are the pros and cons of the two approaches?)

<details><summary><span>Check results</span></summary>
<p>

The log-likelihood of the `itn_coverage` would be printed out and look like this:
```commandline
   itn_coverage        ll
0          0.20 -3.719067
1          0.25 -3.472211
2          0.30 -3.509376
3          0.35 -3.098715
4          0.40 -2.643516
5          0.45 -2.683272
6          0.50 -2.561883
```

And here is the plot out of `select_w7.py` script.
On the left is the observed data (size of bubble is proportionate to sample size) vs simulated mean PfPR trajectory. 
On the right is the `itn_coverage` values and their corresponding log-likelihood.

- Modify  `python generate_input_files.py` as instructed below:
  - add a function that takes existing demographics json file and add individual properties to it
    in this example, we group individuals into a high and a low access group.
    ```py
    ## Add Individual Properties (IPs)
    def add_IPs(demo_fname):
        """Add VaccineStatus IP"""
        IPs = [{'Property': 'Access',
                'Values': ['Low', 'High'],
                'Initial_Distribution': [0.5, 0.5],
                'Transitions': []}
               ]
    
        adf = pd.DataFrame({'Property': 'VaccineStatus',
                            'Property_Value': ['Low', 'High'],
                            'Initial_Distribution': [0.5, 0.5]}
                           )
        adf['Property_Type'] = 'IP'
        adf['node'] = 1
    
        IP_demo_fname = os.path.join(demo_fname.replace('.json', '_wIP.json'))
        generate_demographics_properties(refdemo_fname=demo_fname,
                                         output_filename=IP_demo_fname,
                                         as_overlay=False,
                                         IPs=IPs,
                                         df=adf)
    ```
    Instead of recreating the demographics and climate files, comment these out and add a call for the new `add_IPs` function as shown below:
    ```py
    inputs_path = os.path.join('./', 'input/Namawala')
    ```
    
    ```py
    demo_fname = os.path.join(inputs_path,'Namawala_single_node_demographics.json') 
    # generate_demographics(df, demo_fname)
    # generate_climate(demo_fname)  # no need to generate a 2nd time
    add_IPs(demo_fname)
    ```
- Run `python generate_input_files.py` to generate the new demographics json file `Ghana_demographics_wIP.json`, and inspect the file to check whether the IP's were successfully added.
  - Optional, do the same for the Ghana demographics    
- Copy and rename both simulation scripts from week 7 to `run_exampleSim_w8a.py` and `run_exampleSim_w8b.py`
- __In both simulation scripts:__
  - set `Disable_IP_Whitelist` to 1 (if not already set at 1)
    ```py
    cb.update_params({'Disable_IP_Whitelist' : 1})
    ```
  - Update the demographics filename in `cb.update_params({
    'Demographics_Filenames': [os.path.join('Namawala', 'Namawala_single_node_demographics.json')],` to read in `Namawala_single_node_demographics_wIP.json`
  - Change `exp_name` to week 8 to keep track of simulations + weeks
- Submit burnin experiment to run

The new demographics file should include the text chunk shown below:

#### PART II: Account for IP's in intervention and reports

<details><summary><span>Click here to expand</span></summary>
<p>

_Note: Having the IPs included in the demographics won't have any effect on the simulation if interventions or campaigns do not distinguish individuals by their properties._

- Modify the `run_exampleSim_w8b.py` script:
  - Add a helper function to re-calculate coverage depending on access group
  - Modify the interventions (i.e.add_ITN) to customize coverage levels for low versus high access groups.
    - duplicate the `add_ITN` within the def `itn_intervention` function
    - add `ind_property_restrictions` to have one set of ITNs be distributed to the low,
      the other to the high access group.
    - define two new parameters coverage_levels_low and coverage_levels_high 
    <details><summary><span>view modified itn_intervention</span></summary>
    <p>

    ```py
    def itn_intervention(cb, coverage_level):

    - For simplicity, set all intervention coverage levels >0.5 (due to the assumotions on coverage access made in this example)
    - Add additional reporters to be able to analyze results for both groups
      ```py
       "Report_Event_Recorder_Individual_Properties": ['Access']
      ```
      ```py
       sim_start_year = 2000 + pull_year # for convenience to read simulation times
       add_summary_report(cb, start=1+365*i, interval=30,
                     duration_days=365,
                     age_bins=[0.25, 5, 120],
                     description=f'Monthly_U5_accesslow{sim_start_year+i}',
                     ipfilter = 'Access:Low')
       add_summary_report(cb, start=1+365*i, interval=30,
                 duration_days=365,
                 age_bins=[0.25, 5, 120],
                 description=f'Monthly_U5_accesshigh{sim_start_year+i}',
                 ipfilter = 'Access:High')  
      ```
       - _Note: once we made sure it is doing what it is supposed to do, 
         keeping reporters per group might not always be needed, depending on the research question. 
         In the EMOD How To example, StudyCohort is defined using IP's and in that case having reports for each study group is one of the reasons to use IP's_
    
- Once the burnin simulation finished, update exp_id in `run_exampleSim_w8b.py`
  - Update ModBuilder to have only single coverage levels for the interventions included in your simulation (otherwise result plots will look messy)
- Run the pickup experiment (`run_exampleSim_w8b.py`)
- Run the analyzer script for Week 8 `analyze_exampleSim_w8.py` 
- Inspect results, the generated plots as well as IndividualEvents
- Options for further exploration:
  - Rerun burnin + pickup simulation with different ratio between low and high access group
- Think about what other individual properties would be useful and how these could be implemented.
